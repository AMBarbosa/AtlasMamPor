We can not provide data on finer spatial or temporal resolutions.


All UTM cells included in the table have at least one presence record of the corresponding species, which can either be recent/confirmed or not according to the criteria below.


COLUMNS IN THE TABLE:

-utm10-
UTM code of the 10x10 km cell (or name of the island, for the Azores and Madeira archipelagos) where the species was recorded

-centr_x-
longitude (in decimal degrees) of the centroid of the cell or island

-centr_y-
latitude (in decimal degrees) of the centroid of the cell or island

-especie- [species]
scientific name of the recorded species

-ordem-
common name (in Portuguese) of the taxonomic order to which the species belongs

-recente- [recent]
1: yes - presence observed in or after the year 2000
0: no - presence observed between 1990 and 1999
NA: presence without a record of the year of observation

-confirmado- [confirmed]
1: yes - presence record confirmed according to the criteria outlined in chapter "Metodologia" of the source book (above)
0: no - presence record not confirmed, but obtained by a naturalist (amateur or professional) and plausible given the species' ecology and known distribution area
-1: really no - record obtained by general public survey, with credibility conditioned to the ease of correct identification of the species
NA: presence record not recent (cf. previous column), so not classified here (see "Metodologia")
